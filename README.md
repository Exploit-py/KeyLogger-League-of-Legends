# KeyLogger-League-of-Legends
This project studies Keyloggers and the language itself. It monitors the League of Legends login, saving input to a local TXT file and capturing clipboard content (ctrl + C / ctrl + V). After losing focus, it sends the file to a Flask server, creating a folder with the victim's IP and logs. Misuse is a crime, and I am not liable for your actions.
